## Bug reporting guidelines

- Please *only* report bugs or missing Minecraft features here
- File *one* issue per bug / missing feature
- Mention the version number
- The more information, the better
- Bugs include:
   - Crashes
   - Error messages in chat/console
   - Incorrect “numbers”, inonsistent with Minecraft (drops, health, probabilities, weapon damage, etc.)
   - Incorrect behaviour / gameplay, inconsistent with Minecraft's gameplay
   - MineClone 2 doesn't have a feature that Minecraft has
   - Missing crafting recipes
   - Poor usability in your opinion
   - Typos
- Be prepared to post proof for any claims of incorrect gameplay, especially when it's about internal numbers. A link to Minecraft Wiki or a Let's Play video (don't forget to mention the time!) is usually enough
- For crashes and error messages, please post the output of the debug log
- A feature request is okay if:
   - It's about a feature that Minecraft has
   - It's a GUI or usability improvement in general
- The following things will be instantly rejected:
   - Pull requests
   - Support requests (go to the forums instead)
   - Requests to deviate from Minecraft gameplay
   - Requests to include proprietary code or data

Keep these things in mind:

- The current target of this clone is Minecraft version 1.11, PC Edition
- The highest priority of this clone is to clone Minecraft's *gameplay*
- It is not the goal to imitate the GUI perfectly (only roughly)
- I intentionally added a couple of crafting recipes not found in Minecraft to make it possible to access some currently otherwise unobtainable items
