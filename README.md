## Issue guidelines

- *One* issue per bug
- Prepare to bring the following information:
   - What went wrong
   - How to reproduce the bug (if possible)

### Missing features
- Be prepared to post proof for any claims of incorrect gameplay. A link to Minecraft Wiki or a Let's Play video (with time!) is usually enough
- A feature request is okay if:
   - It's about a feature that Minecraft has
   - It's a GUI or usability improvement in general

## Scope of MineClone 2
Please keep the scope of MineClone 2 in mind when posting issues:

- The current target of this clone is Minecraft version 1.11, PC Edition
- Adding features of later versions is possible, but they are all automatically of low priority
- The highest priority of this clone is to clone Minecraft's *gameplay*
- It is not the goal to imitate the GUI perfectly (only roughly)
- I intentionally added a couple of crafting recipes not found in Minecraft to make it possible to access some currently otherwise unobtainable items
